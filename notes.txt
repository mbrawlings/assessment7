--As you can see in the above results, the doublerAppend scales much better
--than the doublerInsert function does. You can tell by how little the times
--are increasing with the larger array. The doublerInsert function on the other
--hand does not scale well. You can tell because of how long the runtime gets
--as the array increases in size.

Extra Credit

--The doublerInsert function takes so much longer because it uses the unshift
--method. This requires each element in the array to have to shift a space each
--time a new number is 'unshifted' into the array. The push method just adds the
--new number to the end without having to shift all of the contents.
